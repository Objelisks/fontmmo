OPTIMIZATIONS

use static vector copy instead of clone


chunk definition A: streamed chunks
  square shape
  load nearest 3 chunks
  whole area is navigable
  list of collider objects

chunk definition B: diorama graph  <==  WINNER
  arbitrary polygon shape
  load connected chunk on exit
  enter/exit zones marked
  navigable area marked
  list of collider objects

chunk definition C: loose objects
  no large terrain mesh
  individual pieces sent as encountered
  less sent at once, but more to send?

chunk editor: Electron+THREE.js
  draw polygon: geometry/verticies
  draw decoration: paths (geometry+shader?)
  draw enter/exit zones, tag with connected chunk + offset
  draw navigable grid
  place objects, tag with object id

workflow:
  build terrain in blender + materials
  import terrain into editor -> convert materials, simplify json data
  mark zones -> add connection, offset in editor
  export final json

future needs from editor:
  zone placement
  object placement
  npc placement -> settings, dialogue?
  events

terrain
-------
hmm maybe fuck the grid???
  grid: 1bitmap texture gives collision map
  naturally adheres to grid
non-playable area does not need to conform to grid
  river might widen, but edges should cleanly fit grid edges
  each subarea should give an interesting battle arena
    break up with collidable objects

FOREST ZONE
  trees, bushs, small boulders, river, cool leafs shader, paths

MOUNTAIN ZONE
  rocks, cliffs, paths




world building
--------------
villages
npcs
neutral mobs (only in groups)
chunky soft rocks, crystalline structure, grown
world contains no metals
  glass, wood, organic(vine, moss, grass), paper, rock(obsidian, crystal)
  orthogonal high fantasy concept
    can extend tech as far as possible minus metal
    no nails (except wood/stone), swords(obsidian)
    no tall structures, localized farming only (stone tools)
    weapons: hand-to-hand, leather, wood, stone, obsidian(rare), magical
    armor: leather, wood, magical, aesthetics more important
goals:
  GEMWAR
  TOWNBUILD??

modes
  exploreMode -> conflictMode
  conflictMode -> exploreMode

needs to be able to switch active module
needs to be able to interact with controlled player/minions


game actions
  explore
    realtime movement in 360 degree directions
  conflict
    enter combat -> grid based movement, tactics like gameplay, turn based actions with time limit
  interact
    talk to npcs, use abilities on terrain


TODO: rate limiting on all apis per ip (not connection)



health is small integer: 4
  unharmed, hurt, x, wounded, ded
  health is only visible when at 1-2 left

simple inventory
  only maintain rough amounts of items
    one/few/many
  one:
    can only hold one at a time, when used, need to find/make a new one
    alternatively, has unlimited uses, because not used up when used
  few:
    unlimited use in overworld, limited to 3/5/9 uses in conflict
  many:
    functions as item, but unlimited uses, some items(specialized pouch) or ability mutation can increase few -> many
