conflict complications
  collision objects
  danger zones (dot, timed)
  systems: insert cause-effect inbetween cause-effect chains

systems (brogue)
  fire -> sets fire to flammable -> burned objects damaged, spreads fire
  spells -> leaves magic essence -> builds up until threshold -> dissipates over time
  magic essence -> triggered by spells -> bursts into force + damage
  language -> babel -> nonsense
  clouds of gaseous (magic, language, gas, rain, poison, virus)

conflict (converging towards arcade (bomberman aesthetic))
  turn based vs free time // free
  grid based vs free movement // free
  select ability vs press ability btn // press

options:
  choose 1-2 conflict, 0-1 magjick, 0-1 feud
  additive classes: collect classes, but can only have one of a set active?

1 CONFLICT / 1 MAJICK / 1 FEUD / 0+ LESSER

combinations of classes: options
combat / magic / allegiance
Pug/Tele/Def -> ranged punches
Alc/Bio/Cart -> grow chemicals free

-> each combination gives special synthesis abilities

abilities are useful in overworld as well as combat (see Golden Sun)
  movement, obstacles (creating, removing), combat

punch, burn, burst, cloak, growth, water, blink, teleport, haste, slow, rune+combat, reveal
obstacles:
